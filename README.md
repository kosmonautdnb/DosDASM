# DosDASM
The DASM Macro Assember Ported To DOS/FreeDOS (e.g. 6502 Opcodes)

The original repository of the DASM Macro Assembler is to be found at:  
https://github.com/dasm-assembler/dasm  

You can compile it with OpenWatcom2.0 by calling !MAKE.BAT from DOS (e.g. FreeDOS).  

DASM is an assembler and a helpful tool if you develop for older systems like C64 and Plus/4 or C16. Refer to the original repository for all the details. This one should just produce a DASM.EXE to be run under DOS/FreeDOS.
